                <strong>BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE SYSTEM</strong>
                <p>
                    Fingerprint verification is one of the most reliable personal identification methods in biometrics. With the rapid development of fingerprint verification, a number of its applications have been proposed until now including time attendance system etc. In this a fingerprint attendance management system is designed and implemented. This system based biometrics and serial port communication technique solves the problem of spurious attendance and trouble of maintaining the register. It can make the usersâ€™ attendances more easily and effectively.

                <strong>BRAIN TUMOR DETECTIONS AND CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK</strong>
                <p>
                    This study explores the critical realm of brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that disrupts normal brain function and may pose serious health risks. Leveraging the power of CNN, our approach seeks to revolutionize the identification process through the analysis of MRI images. The CNN acts as a sophisticated interpreter, meticulously scrutinizing intricate patterns within brain scans to discern subtle abnormalities indicative of tumors. By training the CNN on diverse MRI datasets, our method enhances accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and pathological neural structures. This research signifies a pivotal advancement in medical diagnostics, showcasing how CNN-driven analysis of MRI images contributes to early and precise detection of brain tumors, offering improved prospects for patient care and treatment outcomes.
